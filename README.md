## My process

Before starting to code I've created an empty git repository and initialized a git repository inside my project folder, then I set the git remote to the newly created repository.
After that I reviewed design and wrote down HTML structure of elements along with the class names using double and single dash notation. I've created a new preparation branch and went on implementing HTML structure along with global imports of fonts and stylesheets. I've pushed the code and merged it to main branch. I went from mobile view and populated all HTML elements and styled them using CSS. I've done mobile view first and then used media query to style it on bigger viewports.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
